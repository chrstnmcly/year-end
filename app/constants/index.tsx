The next morning, mama made breakfast for you, and I came back to check on you again. That night, as we slept side by side for the first time, I realized how deeply I wanted to be the one who takes care of you, cherishes every moment with you, and makes you feel loved in every way.",

Looking back, I realize that the universe had a plan all along—it was telling me I wouldn’t meet him unless I was with you. And when the moment finally came, it felt like the perfect timing, just like his song 'It’s the Right Time to Fall in Love Again.' Being with you made everything fall into place, and I’m so glad we shared that experience together.",
